# The source code for Image Processing and Acquisition using Python, First edition

### Authors - Ravi Chityala and Sridevi Pudipeddi

This repo contains the source code of all examples from the book. We have also included solution to some of the exercise problems.

The book was originally written for Skimage 0.7.x. In early 2015, a new version of Skimage 0.11.x was released. The new version was not backward compatible with version 0.7.x. So we prepared two version of the code. 
If you are using Skimage version 0.7.x then use files from the folder "Skimage0.7". The printed book contains code that uses Skimage 0.7.x 
If you have installed Python recently or if you have upgraded Skimage, then you will have Skimage 0.11.x. In such a case, use files from the folder, "Skimage0.11"

### Errata
As we find errors in the book or the code, we will be documenting in the file errata.md.
